	<p class="body">I think it can be helpful to anthropomorphize the web in order to adequately analyze it, when it comes down to it- websites are a lot like people. Not everyone we meet is good for us, and not everyone we like is either. We all like the spaces on the web created by massive corporate conglomorates- facebook, google, instagram, twitter, just as celebrity in mass media these entities penetrate into the collective psyche of the public and heavily influence our digital lives. Sure, I suppose if asked I would 'like' the celebrity du jour- but through further introspection I likely would have a change of heart due to the nature of the concept of celebrity itself. Just as its often easier to partake in meaningless social distraction, the popular kids of the internet draw us in with their alluring and often addictive web design, bells, and whitsles,  often encouraging us to partake in actions and traits we dont value.

	Everyone has a Nonna on the web, we just have to find it.
	</br>
	</br>
	Though we often spend our Saturdays planning our Saturday nights out with the popular kids, and although it is often not the first thing on our minds, when we do make the trip out to visit our Nonna we never regret it. Interactions that place value on the user, that spark interest or imagination, that encourage self actualization and the development of self. These concepts, these people aren't always the most convenient to visit, they aren't hosted where they are easiest to find, they don't text us or have notifications, we often are required to deploy agency in seeking them out and ensuring we participate with them.

	But they are unique, they are contrarian, they are quirky, (they sometimes have to be taken with a grain of salt,) but they are not 'the cloud'. They are individuals, whos flaws can be endearing and appreciated, who can pass in and out of our lives, and who are sometimes a little difficult to work with. It is important to remember the value these individuals bring to our lives, and to preserve the community that facilitates their wellbeing.
