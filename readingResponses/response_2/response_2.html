	<h1>RESPONSE</br>TWO</h1>

		“Perhaps we are so fascinated by the progress of digital technology because it brings us closer to understanding ourselves.”
	</p>
	<p>
		The existence of the terms UI and UX to me imply a level of control and malleability within the core user base of a particular application, website, or digital ‘experience’. That our decisions as users, or our ‘experiences’ can be funnelled into expected actions using clever design, and those outcomes simultaneously should feel seamless and new to us, while being predictable and on course with the intended experience of the digital work.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Tools shape the way we behave. We point, swipe, skim, type, click, send. How can we reconsider the actions we perform in our daily interfaces?”
	</p>
	<p>
		For most of our daily digital intake these tools are nearly invisible- as I sit and write this in my notes on my iPhone during my long commute there is hardly a thought in my mind to the implications of the actions I am taking on this device. Swipe gestures to swap between the article and this application, seamless streaming of music triggered by the press of a button on my headphones, the occasional gesture to check on my notification centre or control centre. All of these actions go largely unconsidered for the majority of my own (and I would hazard a guess to say likely most others) digital activities on a daily basis.

		Sue seems to be arguing that we should both acknowledge and deeply consider these actions that we take while interfacing with digital technologies, and that we should claim authorship of said actions. These are two separate considerations, the latter deeply dependant on the initiation of the former, but when done in conjunction allow us to engage with our digital environments in a much richer way. The first step of deeply acknowledging the actions largely includes understanding the limitations that are placed on our actions based on the given digital experience that we are engaged in. “We point, we swipe, we click, we send.” The argument is as follows; not only are we limited by these methods of interaction, our actions are shaped by them. Within any given application any number of possible interactions can be intentionally revoked from the user at the hands of the ‘experience’ designer- actions as simple as being able to highlight and copy text or view a scroll bar on a website. The actions that we are actually able to carry out within any given digital space, especially within contemporary digital culture, are for the most part actions that have been allowed to us by the designer. The latter piece exists within our ability, willingness, and intent concerning the way that we take authorship of these digital actions. Treading into the notion of the ‘Touring Complete User”, once our actions are deeply considered we can begin to take counter-actions to employ our own authorship. Using applications beyond their intended purposes, exploiting bugs, or building entire computers in Minecraft. Once our tools are known to us, we can begin to use them as we see fit, rather than as they have been fit to us.

		Removing Form From Function
	</p>
	<p>
		To me the idea of removing form from function aligns deeply with my experiences both in the early web, and now as a design student. This is largely due to the fact that I both rarely understand the tools given to me, and often work towards the idea of a finished form- using said tools to navigate that path. This often results in exactly what Seu speaks of in this section, work that explore the possibilities, the accidental outcomes, and the unintended consequences of the digital tools afforded to me. To me this practice is deeply rooted in the two ideas discussed earlier; an awareness of the actions allowed by a program, and an authorship over those actions in order to subvert the notion of a ‘seamless’ experience likely intended by the UX designer.
		Here’s the thing, I love Minecraft. Shamelessly. I was in the class of ‘09- buying the game in alpha the week it came out, and to this day I play on a server with a few friends where we employ industrialized projects like what I am going to discuss. My friends and I play the game in ‘vanilla’, meaning we have no plugins on our server, no mods installed, not even a texture pack to change the default look of the game. Minecraft is super open to a rich modding community, and we could play with any number of additional elements of the game or ease of life features- but we don’t. This is a point of pride for us.
		Every skyscraper we have ever built, every industrial farm, villager breeder, and red stone contraption that exists in our world exists exactly in the environment the developers released to us, and have intended that we work in.

	<p>
		This is my example, what is called a 0-tick farm. To explain in short what is going on, sugar cane has a growth rate in the game of minutes- it sprouts an additional block on top of itself until it is 3 blocks tall, and this takes many real life minutes to happen. What this farm does, is it takes advantage of a deep understanding of ‘ticks’ (measurements of in game time), and employs it to its advantage. Someone figured out that if you use piston blocks in game, to rapidly shift a block back and forth, the sugar cane stays in place. This 'updates' the block in game, and updating the block in game is the equivalent of the block updating itself over time (which is how the reed is supposed to grow). So by shifting the block beneath the reed back and forth, it updates the block that the reed is growing in, and makes it grow thousands of times per hour- rather than 10s of times per hour.

	<p>
		If this isn't what Seu was talking about in regards to the poetics of tools, I don't know what is. Someone went through all the trouble, rather than exploiting the game or making a mod, using a line of command in game to gift the item to themselves, they looked deeply into the code of the game in order to get what they want out of it- they used the tools that they were given, within the ruleset of the developer, to manipulate the digital environment in which they exist so far beyond what the developer would have ever intended. They created poetry with their tools.
