	<h1>RESPONSE</br>ONE</h1>
	<p>
		I find Lialina's opinion of the word "user" to be quite interesting, and with the overwhelming speed the contemporary age of technology is moving at I find it even more relevant today than in 2012. In particular I found interest in the notion of the user first being coined as a proud and self identifying term with earlier pioneers of computing and web development- sort of a badge of honour that "I, myself, am a user of computers". The origins of such a prolific term that we so primarily associate with digital interface and interaction being coined by the participants themselves, rather than developers is telling of how we used to view our interactions. The corrosion of this term primarily on behalf of UX designers is also incredibly telling of the direction those who wield power in the technology world would like us to head in terms of our subconscious interactions with computing- which I would fully agree with Lialina in her analysis that this seems to be quite deliberate.

		"Users were for the interfaces. Experiences, they are for the PEOPLE!"

		"The use of “people” in this context is a good way to remind software developers that the User is a human being and needs to be taken into account in design and validation processes..."

		"...Being a User is the last reminder that there is, whether visible or not, a computer, a programmed system you use."
	</p>
	<p>

		My personal response to the narrative being outlined by Lialina is that the removal of the terms "user" and "interface" are an incredibly deliberate and calculate step towards removing technology from the consumer culture, and hurdling it into the self. Though material culture has been relevant to humankind from the point we found out we could use objects for greater purpose, the personal attachment and identity we build with objects has undoubtably skyrocketed in the age of marketing and late capitalism. To me, there is no more all encompassing  object that we have ever so greatly identified with, used, and relied upon than the computer.
	</p>
	<p>

		To me, the removal of the term "user" is another step towards the seemingly inevitable post-human future; the destruction of the barriers we create between the material world and our sense of self, whose connection was once symbolic, will become literal. In the post-human future we will be the computer- the only question will be who owns the patent.
	</p>
	<p>
		I do appreciate and can personally identify with Lialina's concept of the "General Purpose User", since my earliest memories of the internet I can remember vividly the seemingly absurd workarounds my friends and I implemented accomplish our goals- far beyond the scope of the developers "intent". One of the earliest "gaps" I remember filling as a general purpose user was grossly misusing MSN's ability to add "custom fonts" to the program. The original intent of course being you could add your own glittery typeface, likely found online, to be used with your friends in chatrooms. I recall downloading these fonts, and opening the image files- you could replace these with any image of a surprisingly large size. This meant at the push of a button you could access, on demand, your own bootlegged frankensteins monster of a contemporary emoji keyboard within your chat rooms. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I have continued with the spirit of the "general purpose user", I use a "picture collage app" on my phone, marketed towards those who want to make grids of 6 photos with glittery frames around them, to make memes on the go. The reason being that it is much better than the mobile version of photoshop or any other application traditionally designed for and associated with "photo editing", this app has a one step process that allows you to trace a portion of an image with your finger in order to "cut it out"- allowing you to mashup images and create incredibly specific cultural references in an instant. This paired with the serviceable placement and sizing of type, and a few other features, means an output of a completely radical opposite of the intended users output. This function is a tiny function, likely not even used by the apps primary user base, in a much larger and completely different "experience" designed by the UX designer- but as someone who grew up without a computer that could run after effects, using workarounds in iMovie to composite special effects (beyond their designed intent), I swear by my general purpose use of this app. 
	</p>
	<p>

		All this is to say that I am fearful. I am fearful of a future where the "user" truly disappears and is replaced by nothing. We cease to use technology as it literally becomes a part of us, and our technological experience and human experience are literally no longer separable. A post-human future in which our sense of self moves from relying and identifying with the data we create, to legally being one single entity. To me, the deliberate corrosion of the idea of the "user" is one more step towards making the fusion palatable, or perhaps simply unnoticed.
