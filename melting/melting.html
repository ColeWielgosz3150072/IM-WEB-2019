	<p>A DAT:// website with a poem reading 'Standing at the Precipice Engulfed in a Cacophony of Silence, the Oldest Computer Halts.' is seeded to peers as it sits below a melting block of ice. As peers access the website, the initial files succumb to the drowning along with the computer it was hosted on, leaving the only remnants of the site to exist within the connection of the remaining peers. After the final computer disconnects from the site, the digital space ceases to exist entirely.
