		<div class="clockInfo">"The Doomsday Clock is a symbol which represents the likelihood of a man-made global catastrophe. Maintained since 1947 by the members of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, The Clock is a metaphor for threats to humanity from unchecked scientific and technical advances. The Clock represents the hypothetical global catastrophe as "midnight" and the Bulletin's opinion on how close the world is to a global catastrophe as a number of "minutes" to midnight. The factors influencing the Clock are nuclear risk and climate change. The Bulletin's Science and Security Board also monitors new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict irrevocable harm to humanity." {wikipedia}</div>

		<div class="climateAPI">"The Climate Data API provides programmatic access to most of the climate data used on the World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal. Web developers can use this API to access the knowledge portal’s data in real time to support their own applications, so long as they abide by the World Bank’s Terms of Use." {datahelpdesk.worldbank.org}</div>

		<div class="steps">
			-determine data that can be pulled from api and successfully display it</br>
			-experiment with visual metaphors, determine a successful visual approach</br>
			-build features into the visual that are altered by the change in live api data</br>
			-clean up && polish it!!
